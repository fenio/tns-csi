# IMPORTANT: Before this workflow can run successfully, GitHub Pages must be enabled:
# 1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
# 2. Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions"
# 3. Save the settings
#
# This one-time manual step is required because GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't have
# permission to enable Pages programmatically.
